=======================

Gas flow rates are controlled by ALICAT flow controllers and recorded in EC-Lab through the analog inputs of the potentiostat.
The flow controller for the inlet gas flow is expected to be connected to channel 1 and the flow meter for the outlet flow rate (and inlet for the GC) is expected to be connected to channel 2.
